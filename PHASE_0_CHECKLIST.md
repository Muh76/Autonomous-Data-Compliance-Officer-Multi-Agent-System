# Phase 0: ADK Setup & Learning - Checklist

## Objectives

- [x] Research and understand Google ADK architecture
- [ ] Set up ADK development environment
- [ ] Learn ADK's built-in agent classes
- [ ] Understand AgentTools and agent lifecycle
- [ ] Create ADK integration guide/documentation

## Tasks

### 1. Research & Documentation

- [x] Create ADK integration guide (`docs/adk/README.md`)
- [x] Create setup guide (`docs/adk/setup.md`)
- [x] Create agent classes learning guide (`learning/adk/agent_classes.md`)
- [x] Create integration strategy document (`docs/adk/integration_strategy.md`)
- [x] Create learning resources structure

### 2. Environment Setup

- [ ] Install Google ADK
  ```bash
  pip install google-adk
  ```
- [ ] Verify installation
  ```bash
  python learning/adk/test_adk_setup.py
  ```
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Configure IDE/editor for ADK development

### 3. Learning & Practice

- [ ] Read ADK documentation
- [ ] Study agent classes guide
- [ ] Review example code
- [ ] Complete learning exercises:
  - [ ] Exercise 1: Simple LlmAgent
  - [ ] Exercise 2: SequentialAgent Pipeline
  - [ ] Exercise 3: ParallelAgent Scanner
  - [ ] Exercise 4: Coordinator Workflow

### 4. Integration Planning

- [ ] Review integration strategy
- [ ] Understand compatibility requirements
- [ ] Plan agent migration approach
- [ ] Identify integration points with existing code

### 5. Documentation Review

- [ ] Review all created documentation
- [ ] Update based on actual ADK structure (if different)
- [ ] Create quick reference guide
- [ ] Document any ADK-specific patterns discovered

## Notes

- ADK structure may differ from examples - adjust as needed
- Focus on understanding patterns, not exact implementation
- Keep notes on ADK-specific features and limitations
- Document any integration challenges encountered

## Completion Criteria

Phase 0 is complete when:

1. ✅ ADK is installed and verified
2. ✅ All documentation is created
3. ✅ Learning materials are reviewed
4. ✅ At least 2 example agents are working
5. ✅ Integration strategy is understood
6. ✅ Ready to proceed to Phase 1

## Next Phase

Once Phase 0 is complete, proceed to:
**Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Foundation (SIMPLIFIED)**
